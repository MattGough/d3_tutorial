## D3 Tutorial

Following this [D3 tutorial](http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3), I created a bar chart and a scatter plot graph using SVG. The bars on the bar chart vary hue with the y value. The scatter plot graph in its final form has scalable axes that alter to the size of the input data which is randomised on page refresh. You can see these below.
